    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic South Asian dish made with spiced
      rice, marinated meat (such as chicken, mutton, beef, or fish), and
      sometimes vegetables. It is cooked using a layering technique, where rice
      and meat are alternately stacked and slow-cooked with fragrant spices like
      saffron, cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves.
